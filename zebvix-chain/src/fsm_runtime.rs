//! FSM runtime adapter (Phase B.3.2.7 — F006.1 → F006.4 ship).
//!
//! This module is the **integration layer** between the pure consensus FSM
//! (`crate::fsm`) and the live node services (`State`, `Mempool`,
//! `VotePool`, p2p gossip). It is intentionally *dormant* in this commit:
//!
//! 1. `enabled()` reads `ZEBVIX_FSM_ENABLED` and returns `false` by
//!    default, so existing operators are not auto-upgraded.
//! 2. `FsmRuntime::run` returns immediately when `enabled()` is `false`
//!    so a `tokio::spawn(rt.run())` task drops cleanly.
//! 3. Nothing in `main.rs` calls `FsmRuntime::run` yet. The legacy
//!    `Producer::run` continues to drive consensus, byte-identically to
//!    pre-B.3.2.7 behaviour. F006.7 will introduce the pre-emption path.
//!
//! ## What's new in F006.4 vs F006.3
//! F006.3 shipped a single `handle_action` dispatch surface with a
//! warn+sleep `run()` guard. F006.4 turns that surface into a working
//! event-driven loop:
//!
//! - **Vote-pool watcher** (`poll_vote_quorums`): walks the pool's
//!   tally APIs at the current `(height, round)` and emits
//!   `FsmEvent::PrevoteQuorum` / `PrecommitQuorum` for each target
//!   that has crossed the 2/3+ threshold. Dedup via
//!   `last_emitted_quorum` so a stable quorum doesn't spam the FSM.
//! - **Tick clock** (`tick_once`): drives `FsmEvent::Tick` into the
//!   FSM at the same 500ms cadence as the legacy producer.
//! - **Proposal cache** (`proposal_cache`): bounded `BTreeMap` of
//!   `(height → Block)` populated by `cache_proposal` (callable from
//!   any future p2p ingress) and consumed by
//!   `handle_action(CommitBlock)` to source the actual `Block` bytes
//!   for `state.apply_block`. Capped at `PROPOSAL_CACHE_CAP = 64`
//!   entries; oldest height evicted on overflow.
//! - **Startup recovery** (`recover_from_state`): derives the FSM
//!   start height from `state.tip().0 + 1`. Honors the existing
//!   commit-blob mismatch guard in `state.rs` (lines 2767–2780)
//!   which already halts startup if the last commit was a partial
//!   write — F006.4 simply trusts `state.tip()` because that's the
//!   post-recovery value once the operator clears the marker.
//! - **Real event loop** (`run`): replaces the F006.3 warn+sleep
//!   guard with a `tokio::select!` loop that drives the tick clock
//!   + vote-pool watcher when `enabled()=true`. Exits immediately
//!   when `enabled()=false` (no warning, no busy-wait) so a
//!   pre-emptive future caller can `tokio::spawn(rt.run())` on
//!   every startup unconditionally.
//!
//! ## What's NOT in F006.4 (deferred)
//! - **Legacy pre-emption** (F006.7): even with `enabled()=true`,
//!   this commit does NOT stop `consensus::Producer::run` from
//!   driving consensus. The FSM loop runs in parallel as a *shadow
//!   observer* — its `BuildProposal`/`BroadcastPrevote`/
//!   `BroadcastPrecommit` actions are still log-only stubs (matches
//!   F006.3 behaviour) so it cannot fork the chain. Only
//!   `CommitBlock` reaches `state.apply_block`, and that is gated
//!   by a `state.tip() < height` check that prevents double-apply.
//!   F006.7 will cleanly remove the legacy path once F006.5
//!   (cadence) + F006.6 (gating soak) prove the FSM byte-identical.
//! - **Proposal cache populator** (F006.4.5): no production code
//!   currently calls `cache_proposal`. The cache is wired into
//!   `handle_action(CommitBlock)`'s lookup path so it works in
//!   tests and from manual operator probes, but the p2p ingress
//!   subscription is a separate ship (small enough to bundle with
//!   F006.7 if convenient).
//!
//! ## Activation plan (per `HARDENING_TODO.md` §B.3.2.7)
//! - Dev rehearsal `ZEBVIX_FSM_ENABLED=false`: byte-identical to legacy
//!   over 1000 blocks (gating green-light).
//! - Dev rehearsal `ZEBVIX_FSM_ENABLED=true` under N=1: byte-identical
//!   to legacy (1/1 quorum trivially met, FSM and legacy produce the
//!   same block hash because they read the same mempool).
//! - Mainnet flag flip after ≥7 day soak with flag OFF.
//! - Never flip `ZEBVIX_FSM_ENABLED` and `ZEBVIX_SIGN_HASH_
//!   ACTIVATION_HEIGHT` (C2) on the same restart.
